## What do Seeders/Sorters do?

Seeders and Sorters canvass the resources of a given government agency, identifying important URLs. They identify whether those URLs can be crawled by the Internet Archive's web crawler. If the URLs are crawlable, the Seeders/Sorters nominate them to the [End of Term (EOT) Web Archive](http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/2016.html), otherwise they add them to the Uncrawlable spreadsheet using the project's Chrome Extension.

## Choosing the website

The Seeders/Sorters use the [EDGI Archiving Primers](https://envirodatagov.org/archiving/), or a similar set of resources, to identify important and at-risk data. Talk to the DataRescue organizers to learn more.

## Canvassing the website and evaluating content

- Start exploring the website assigned, identifying important URLs.
- Decide whether the data on a page or website subsection can be automatically captured by the Internet Archive web crawler.
- [EDGI's Guides](https://edgi-govdata-archiving.github.io/guides/) have information critical to the seeding and sorting process:
    - [Understanding the Internet Archive Web Crawler](https://edgi-govdata-archiving.github.io/guides/internet-archive-crawler/)
    - [Seeding the Internet Archive’s Web Crawler](https://edgi-govdata-archiving.github.io/guides/seeding-internet-archive/)

### Crawlable URLs

- URLs judged to be possibly crawlable are "nominated" (equivalently, "seeded") to the End of Term project (EOT), using the [EDGI Nomination Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nominationtool/abjpihafglmijnkkoppbookfkkanklok?hl=en) or

**Wherever possible, add in the Agency Office Code.** Talk to the DataRescue organizers to learn more.

### Uncrawlable URLs

- If URL is judged not crawlable, add it to the "Uncrawlable" spreadsheet through the Chrome Extension.
- In the spreadsheet is automatically associated with a universal unique identifyer (UUID) that was generated in advance.
- You can check whether the page or some files are rendered using the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak)

### Not sure?

- This sorting is only provisional: when in doubt seeders nominate the URL **and** mark it as possibly not crawlable.
